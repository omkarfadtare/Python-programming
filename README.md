# Python-programming
Introduction to Python:
Python was developed by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991. Python was named after 'Monty Python's Flying Circus' a comedy series created by the comedy group Monty Python.
It is a general-purpose programming language that also works nicely as a scripting language.
It is a high level interpreted programming language, which means the source code of python does not need compilation like other languages. Source code of python directly gets converted to binary format at the time of writing code.
It is dynamically typed language, which means the type for a variable is decided at the run time only, we do not have to specify the type of a variable.
